# ER Diagram Workshop â€“ Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Member | Member_ID (PK), Name, Membership_Type, Start_Date|Tracks all gym members|
|Program |Program_ID (PK), Program_Name, Type|Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training|
|Trainer |Trainer_ID (PK), Name, Specialization|A trainer may take multiple programs|
|Session |Session_ID (PK), Member_ID (FK), Trainer_ID (FK), Date, Time|For personal training sessions|
|Attendance|Attendance_ID (PK), Session_ID (FK), Status (Present/Absent)|Records session attendance|

### Relationships and Constraints
