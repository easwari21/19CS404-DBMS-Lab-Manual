# ER Diagram Workshop – Submission Template

## Objective
To understand and apply ER modeling concepts by creating ER diagrams for real-world applications.

## Purpose
Gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that represent database structure including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

# Scenario A: City Fitness Club Management

**Business Context:**  
FlexiFit Gym wants a database to manage its members, trainers, and fitness programs.

**Requirements:**  
- Members register with name, membership type, and start date.  
- Each member can join multiple programs (Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training).  
- Trainers assigned to programs; a program may have multiple trainers.  
- Members may book personal training sessions with trainers.  
- Attendance recorded for each session.  
- Payments tracked for memberships and sessions.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Member | Member_ID (PK), Name, Membership_Type, Start_Date|Tracks all gym members|
|Program |Program_ID (PK), Program_Name, Type|Yoga, Zumba, Weight Training|
|Trainer |Trainer_ID (PK), Name, Specialization|A trainer may take multiple programs|
|Session |Session_ID (PK), Member_ID (FK), Trainer_ID (FK), Date, Time|For personal training sessions|
|Attendance|Attendance_ID (PK), Session_ID (FK), Status (Present/Absent)|Records session attendance|

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|Member–Program (Joins)|M:N|Partial|A member can join many programs|
|Program–Trainer (Assigned)|M:N|Total|Programs can have multiple trainers|
|Session–Attendance|1:M|Partial|Each session must have attendance record|

### Assumptions
- Membership type determines allowed programs but not restricted in ER model.
-Personal training sessions are optional.
-Payments cover both membership fees and session fees.

# Scenario B: City Library Event & Book Lending System

**Business Context:**  
The Central Library wants to manage book lending and cultural events.

**Requirements:**  
- Members borrow books, with loan and return dates tracked.  
- Each book has title, author, and category.  
- Library organizes events; members can register.  
- Each event has one or more speakers/authors.  
- Rooms are booked for events and study.  
- Overdue fines apply for late returns.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
|Member|Member_ID (PK), Name, Email, Phone|Library members|
|Book|Book_ID (PK), Title, Author, Category|Each book has category (Fiction, etc.)|
|Loan|Loan_ID (PK), Book_ID (FK), Member_ID (FK), Loan_Date, Return_Date|Tracks borrowing details|
|Event|Event_ID (PK), Title, Date, Time|Cultural events organized by library|
|Speaker|Speaker_ID (PK), Name, Expertise|Authors or guest speakers|                 
### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|Member–Loan (Borrows)|1:M|Total|Each member can borrow many books|
|Book–Loan|1:M|Total|A book can appear in many loan records|
|Member–Event (Registers)|M:N|Partial|Members can register for events|
|Event–Speaker|M:N|Total|Each event must have at least one speaker|

### Assumptions
- Each event must take place in one room.

- Multiple speakers can be assigned to one event.

- Fine is applied only if return date > due date.

# Scenario C: Restaurant Table Reservation & Ordering

**Business Context:**  
A popular restaurant wants to manage reservations, orders, and billing.

**Requirements:**  
- Customers can reserve tables or walk in.  
- Each reservation includes date, time, and number of guests.  
- Customers place food orders linked to reservations.  
- Each order contains multiple dishes; dishes belong to categories (starter, main, dessert).  
- Bills generated per reservation, including food and service charges.  
- Waiters assigned to serve reservations.

### Entities and Attributes

| Entity | Attributes (PK, FK) | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|

|Reservation|Reservation_ID (PK), Customer_ID (FK), Date, Time, Guests|Reservation details|
|Table|Table_ID (PK), Capacity|Reserved for customers|
|Order|Order_ID (PK), Reservation_ID (FK), Order_Time|Orders placed|
|Dish|Dish_ID (PK), Dish_Name, Price|Menu items|
|Category|Category_ID (PK), Category_Name|Starter, Main, Dessert, Drinks|                    

### Relationships and Constraints

| Relationship | Cardinality | Participation | Notes |
|--------------|------------|---------------|-------|
|Customer–Reservation (Makes)|1:M|Partial|A customer can make multiple reservations|
|Reservation–Table(Assigned)|M:1|Total|Each reservation must have one table|
|Reservation–Order|1:M|Partial|Orders are linked to reservations|
|Order–Dish (Contains)|M:N|Total	Orders contain multiple dishes|              

### Assumptions
- Walk-in customers are entered as new records in the system.

- Each reservation must be linked to exactly one table.

- One bill per reservation (no bill-splitting considered).
